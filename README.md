# arxiv-doi-updater
Small website that checks arXiv entries in BibTeX files for published references


### TODO:

 * Styling
 * Explanatory text
 * Support more than the `archiveprefix` / `eprint` / `primaryclass` tag combo (which is rather uncommon):
   * `note` field as exported by Zotero
   * `url` field
   * What does Mendeley export?
 * Heroku deployment
